## Exploring Package **pg** for Database Operation

### What is a Pool in pg module?
- The Pool class is used to manage a pool of client connections to the PostgreSQL database.
- When you create a Pool object, it establishes a pool of connections to the database.
- Each time you need to perform a database operation, you request a client connection from the pool, perform the operation, and then release the client back to the pool.
- Using a connection pool is more efficient in a multi-user environment because it allows multiple clients to share a fixed number of database connections.
- It's generally recommended to use Pool for most database operations in production applications.

### What is a Client in pg module?
- The Client class represents a single client connection to the PostgreSQL database.
- When you create a Client object, it establishes a single connection to the database.
- Typically, we use a Client when you need to perform a single or a few database operations and don't need to manage connection pooling manually.
- Using a Client can be appropriate for simple scripts or small applications where managing a connection pool is not necessary.
