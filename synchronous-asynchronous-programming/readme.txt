Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Asynchronous programming is a crucial aspect of JavaScript, especially for dealing with tasks like making network requests, 
reading/writing files, handling user interactions, and more.

JavaScript provides various mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations to ensure that your code doesn't 
block the execution of other code

Here are the main concepts and techniques for asynchronous programming in JavaScript:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Callbacks
-----------------------------
Callback functions are one of the earliest and most common ways to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. 
You pass a function as a callback to be executed when an operation is completed.

2.

3. Async/Await:
-----------------------------
1. Async/await is a more recent addition to JavaScript and provides a way to write asynchronous code that 
   resembles synchronous code.
2. It's built on top of Promises and simplifies error handling.
